<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I’m currently a sophomore in college and I have a passion for filmmaking and photography.
  I attend the University of Miami and am majoring in Motion Pictures on the production track.
  I share my content on my personal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bethmosch">YouTube channel</a> which includes vlogs and short films.
  I also run <a href="https://www.moschmedia.com/">Mosch Media</a>, which is a social media company devoted to photography and videography.
  On top of this, I created a streetwear fashion company called <a href="https://venomcollective.storenvy.com/">Venom Collective</a>.</p>
